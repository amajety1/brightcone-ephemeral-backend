# BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit)

**Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)** is a heavy-rail public transit system serving the San Francisco Bay Area in California. It operates on 131 miles (211 km) of track with service to **50 stations** across **six routes** ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Bay%20Area%20Rapid%20Transit%20,system%20in%20the%20United%20States)), including a 9-mile diesel-operated spur (eBART to Antioch) and a 3-mile automated people mover to Oakland Airport ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Bay%20Area%20Rapid%20Transit%20,system%20in%20the%20United%20States)). As of late 2024, BART carries about **167,800 weekday riders**, making it the **7th-busiest** rapid transit system in the U.S. ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Connector%20%2C%20a%203,BART%20is%20the%20%20224)). BART is administered by the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, formed in 1957 ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=United%20States%20)), and it opened for service in stages between 1972 and 1974 ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Passenger%20service%20began%20on%20September,hailed%20as%20a%20major%20step)). The sections below provide comprehensive information on BART’s schedules, stations, fares, history, real-time services, rider policies, current projects, and historical milestones.

## Schedules

 ([File:BART web map effective September 2023.png - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BART_web_map_effective_September_2023.png)) *Daytime system map of BART (service as of September 2023) ([File:BART web map effective September 2023.png - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BART_web_map_effective_September_2023.png#:~:text=English%3A%20%20BART%20daytime%20service,changes%20of%20September%2011%2C%202023)).* 

**Hours of Operation:** BART trains generally run from about **5:00 AM to midnight on weekdays**, 6:00 AM to midnight on Saturdays, and 8:00 AM to midnight on Sundays ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=The%20first%20inbound%20trains%20leave,172%2C%20for%20guaranteed%20transfers)). The **first trains** depart outer terminals around these start times, and the **last trains** of the night depart around midnight, with timed transfers ensured for the final runs (e.g. last trains meet at MacArthur and Bay Fair for connections) ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=The%20first%20inbound%20trains%20leave,172%2C%20for%20guaranteed%20transfers)). BART does **not operate overnight** (typically closed ~1 AM to 5 AM); during these hours, a network of All-Nighter buses provided by regional agencies covers key BART corridors ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Two%20different%20bus%20networks%20currently,when%20BART%20is%20not%20operating)). An Early Bird Express bus network runs in the pre-dawn hour (approx. 3:50–5:30 AM) on weekdays to bridge the gap before BART opens ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=The%20Early%20Bird%20Express%20network,21)).

**Service Frequency:** On weekdays, each BART line runs at **20-minute intervals**, except the busiest **Yellow Line**, which runs every **10 minutes** for much of the day ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=BART%20has%20elements%20of%20both,13)). During peak commute times, segments where lines overlap see higher combined frequency – for example, between Daly City and West Oakland there are about **15 trains per hour** (one every ~4 minutes per direction at peak) due to multiple lines serving that stretch ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=operates%20every%2010%20minutes%20on,The%20%20117%20Oakland%20Airport)). Evenings after 9 PM, service is reduced to three lines (with some lines ending earlier) ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=San%20Jos%C3%A9%20%20Richmond%20,service%20ends%20at%20Millbrae)), resulting in 30-minute headways on each branch. The separate **Oakland Airport Connector** (automated people mover) runs on-demand, usually every ~10 minutes or less ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=operates%20every%2010%20minutes%20on,13)). On weekends, frequencies are generally 20 minutes on each line. BART’s schedule is designed such that all stations are served during all operating hours (though the SFO-Millbrae segment has limited direct service late nights) ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=match%20at%20L1190%20San%20Jos%C3%A9,service%20ends%20at%20Millbrae)).

**Timetables and Planning:** BART provides detailed timetables by line and station via its website and PDF schedules ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=13.%20%5E%20a%20b%20,San%20Francisco)). Riders can use BART’s Trip Planner or official app to input start/end stations and receive customized train schedules ([Parking Overview | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/parking#:~:text=Plan%20Your%20Trip)) ([BART Apps | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/apps#:~:text=The%20official%20BART%20app%20offers,friendly%20and%20fastest)). The system map above shows the five primary heavy-rail lines – **Yellow** (Antioch–SF/Oakland–Millbrae), **Blue** (Dublin/Pleasanton–Daly City), **Orange** (Richmond–Berryessa), **Green** (Daly City–Berryessa), **Red** (Richmond–Millbrae via SF) – plus the separate **OAK Airport** shuttle line ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=extension%20to%20Dublin%2FPleasanton%20%20in,line%20to%20Warm%20Springs%2FSouth%20Fremont)). (After 9 PM, the Red and Green lines cease, and Yellow, Blue, Orange provide reduced late-night service.) BART trains reach speeds up to 70 mph in regular service (with some track segments engineered for 80 mph) ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=standard%20gauge%20rail)), which allows travel from end to end of the system in a bit over an hour. There are a few timed transfer arrangements – for example, the Orange line (East Bay only) and Yellow line (via San Francisco) have a cross-platform transfer at MacArthur, and the Orange line substitutes for the Red line after 9 PM ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Timed%20cross,7)). 

**Night Service:** Because BART’s tunnels and tracks require overnight maintenance, the system remains closed in late-night hours. The region’s All-Nighter bus network (run by AC Transit, Muni, SamTrans, etc.) provides basic overnight public transit, serving most BART station areas except the farthest segments (e.g. Antioch to Rockridge, Bay Fair to Dublin/Pleasanton) ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Two%20different%20bus%20networks%20currently,when%20BART%20is%20not%20operating)). During a planned Bay Bridge closure in 2013, BART ran 24-hour service temporarily, carrying record ridership ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=2009%2C%20following%20an%20emergency%20closure,Golden%20State%20Warriors%20championship%20parade)), but ordinarily there is **no 24-hour rail service**. Riders needing to travel after BART’s closure must use these all-night buses or other modes. BART has occasionally extended hours for special events (e.g. late-night sporting events or New Year’s) but generally adheres to its regular schedule for maintenance reasons.

## Station Details

 ([File:BART train at SFIA station, 2003.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BART_train_at_SFIA_station,_2003.jpg)) *A BART train at San Francisco International Airport Station (2003) ([File:BART train at SFIA station, 2003.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BART_train_at_SFIA_station,_2003.jpg#:~:text=English%3A%20%20BART%20train%20at,International%20Airport%20station%20in%202003)).* 

**Locations:** BART serves **50 stations** across 5 counties: 22 stations in Alameda County, 12 in Contra Costa County, 8 in San Francisco, 6 in San Mateo, and 2 in Santa Clara ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Mateo%20County%20and%20Santa%20Clara,All%20of%20the%20heavy%20rail)). The system’s core runs through downtown San Francisco and Oakland (via the Transbay Tube under the Bay), then extends outward in multiple directions: northeast to Richmond and Antioch, east/southeast to Dublin/Pleasanton and Berryessa/San José, south to Fremont, and southwest to Daly City, SFO Airport, and Millbrae ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Santa%20Clara%20County)) ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=,198)). Many stations in suburban areas are park-and-ride oriented (with parking lots or garages), while the city-center stations are underground and integrated with dense urban environments. Each station’s exact location and transit connections can be found on BART’s station list page ([Parking Overview | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/parking#:~:text=Station%20Details)) or system map.

**Facilities and Amenities:** All BART stations are designed for **full accessibility**. Every station has elevators and escalators connecting the platforms, concourse, and street levels ([Accessibility Overview | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/accessibility#:~:text=Features%C2%A0for%C2%A0those%C2%A0with%C2%A0wheelchairs%C2%A0%26%C2%A0limited%20mobility)), and at least one **wide fare gate** for wheelchairs or strollers ([Accessibility Overview | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/accessibility#:~:text=,Priority%C2%A0seats%3A%C2%A0All%C2%A0train%C2%A0cars%C2%A0have%C2%A0green%C2%A0priority%C2%A0seats%C2%A0to%C2%A0the%C2%A0left%C2%A0of%C2%A0the)). Platforms are generally level with train floors for easy boarding, and there are marked boarding areas for wheelchairs. Most stations have **restrooms**, though BART’s underground downtown stations had their restrooms closed after 2001 for security; as of 2022, BART began reopening these facilities in phases (Powell Street Station’s restrooms reopened in Feb 2022 after being closed for over 20 years) ([Restrooms at Powell Street Station reopen on 2/2/22 | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2022/news20220131#:~:text=On%20Wednesday%2C%20February%202%2C%202022%2C,now%20during%20the%20pandemic%20recovery)). Stations typically offer seating, ticket vending machines, Clipper card add-value machines, and system maps. Many stations also feature bicycle racks or lockers, and **bike stations** (attended bicycle parking facilities) exist at key stops like Fruitvale and Downtown Berkeley.

**Parking:** About half of BART’s stations provide car parking, primarily in the suburban areas. Stations with parking lots (e.g. Daly City, El Cerrito del Norte, Bay Fair, Dublin/Pleasanton, etc.) often have designated **daily fee** parking and **permit** parking areas ([Parking Overview | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/parking#:~:text=)). BART offers reserved parking permits and a “Pay by App” option for daily parking fees ([Parking Overview | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/parking#:~:text=,Pay%20By%20App)). All stations with parking include dedicated accessible parking spaces (disabled placard required, and standard fees apply) ([Accessibility Overview | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/accessibility#:~:text=door%C2%A0on%C2%A0all%C2%A0train%C2%A0cars,Visit%20the%C2%A0parking%20section%C2%A0for%20more%20details)). Some stations have EV charging stations and carpool parking programs ([Parking Overview | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/parking#:~:text=)). Parking availability and policies (such as time limits or permit requirements) are detailed on BART’s website ([Parking Overview | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/parking#:~:text=,Pay%20By%20App)). Urban stations in San Francisco and Oakland generally lack BART-owned parking, encouraging riders to use feeder transit, walk, or bike.

**Accessibility and Safety:** Every BART station is **ADA-accessible** – elevators provide access for wheelchairs (with backup plans posted when an elevator is out of service), and fare gates can accommodate mobility devices ([Accessibility Overview | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/accessibility#:~:text=,Priority%C2%A0seats%3A%C2%A0All%C2%A0train%C2%A0cars%C2%A0have%C2%A0green%C2%A0priority%C2%A0seats%C2%A0to%C2%A0the%C2%A0left%C2%A0of%C2%A0the)). Tactile Braille signage and platform edge strips assist blind or low-vision riders, and audible announcements on trains and in stations provide route and destination information ([Accessibility Overview | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/accessibility#:~:text=Features%C2%A0for%C2%A0blind%C2%A0%26%C2%A0low%C2%A0vision%20riders)). BART stations have emergency intercoms and CCTV security cameras. In terms of design, many 1970s-era stations feature Brutalist concrete architecture, while newer stations (or renovated ones) incorporate more contemporary styles ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Many%20of%20the%20original%201970s,by%20BART%20for%20Muni%20Metro)). Key transfer stations like **MacArthur, Oakland 12th St/19th St, and Downtown SF stations** have multiple mezzanine levels or island platforms to facilitate convenient line transfers.

**Connections:** Nearly all BART stations offer connections to other transportation. In San Francisco, the four downtown BART stations (Embarcadero, Montgomery, Powell, Civic Center) share facilities with Muni Metro light rail lines ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=BART%20and%20most%20lines%20of,12)), and a direct indoor link connects Powell Station to the Union Square Central Subway station ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=four%20stations%20,12)). At **Millbrae**, BART connects with Caltrain commuter rail ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=available%20across%20the%20BART%20system,12)), and at **Richmond** and **Oakland Coliseum**, BART connects with Amtrak intercity trains (Capitol Corridor, San Joaquins, and California Zephyr at Richmond) ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Intermodal%20connections%20to%20local%2C%20regional%2C,12)). Most outlying stations have adjacent **bus transfer centers** served by local agencies: e.g. AC Transit buses at East Bay stations ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=BART%20is%20served%20by%20bus,org%20on)), Muni and SamTrans at San Francisco/Peninsula stations ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=BART%20is%20served%20by%20bus,org%20on)), County Connection and Tri Delta Transit in Contra Costa County ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=connecting%20routes%20,Express%2C%20and%20%20263%20Union)), VTA buses in Santa Clara County, etc. BART’s two airport stations are located directly at **San Francisco International Airport (SFO)** (with a convenient connection to airline terminals) and **Oakland International Airport (via Coliseum Station)** ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Main%20articles%3A%20Oakland%20International%20Airport,station%20%20and%20%20199)); a free shuttle bus from Milpitas connects to San José Airport as well ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Main%20articles%3A%20Oakland%20International%20Airport,station%20%20and%20%20199)). Station pages on bart.gov enumerate available transit connections, bike parking options, and nearby amenities.

## Fares

**Fare Structure:** BART uses a **distance-based fare** system – riders pay according to how far they travel, rather than a flat fare. Fares are calculated by a formula based on mileage, with surcharges added for certain segments ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=A%20surcharge%20is%20added%20for,2%E2%80%939%20%20The%20maximum%20fare)). As of 2022, trips that cross the **Transbay Tube** incur a \$1.40 surcharge, trips to/from **San Francisco International Airport** have an extra \$4.95 surcharge, trips to/from **Oakland International Airport** (via the connector) have an extra \$6.70 surcharge, and trips entering **San Mateo County** (e.g. Millbrae, SFO, South SF) add \$1.25–\$1.45 (since that county is outside the core BART district) ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=A%20surcharge%20is%20added%20for,2%E2%80%939%20%20The%20maximum%20fare)). The *shortest* BART trip (the minimum fare) is around \$2–\$2.15, while the *longest possible* one-way trip (e.g. from Antioch in the far East Bay to San Francisco Airport including all surcharges) can cost up to **\$17.60** ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=match%20at%20L1595%20including%20both,87%20%5D%20As)). On average, riders pay about \$3.93 per trip in practice ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=including%20both%20airport%20surcharges%20and,89)). Because fares are mileage-based, BART does **not offer unlimited-ride passes** (no weekly or monthly passes) ([Clipper and Pay by Phone | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/tickets#:~:text=Fares%20are%20based%20on%20distance,use%20the%20BART%20Fare%20Calculator)) ([Clipper and Pay by Phone | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/tickets#:~:text=BART%20fares%20are%20set%20with,are%20not%20available)), except through special programs (e.g. the “Muni + BART within San Francisco” monthly pass, see below). However, BART provides a Fare Calculator tool online to easily determine the fare between any two stations ([Clipper and Pay by Phone | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/tickets#:~:text=match%20at%20L295%20Fares%20are,use%20the%20BART%20Fare%20Calculator)).

**Payment Media:** The primary fare medium is the **Clipper card**, a reloadable contactless smart card used on transit systems throughout the Bay Area ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=The%20primary%20fare%20media%20for,electronic%20wallets%20can%20also%20be)). Riders “tag” their Clipper card at a fare gate upon entering a station and again when exiting; the appropriate fare is automatically deducted based on the stations traveled ([Clipper and Pay by Phone | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/tickets#:~:text=Paying%20Your%20Fare)). **Clipper is now the exclusive payment method** for BART: the agency phased out its old paper magnetic-stripe tickets – as of December 2020, all stations stopped selling paper tickets, and by December 2023 BART ceased accepting them entirely ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=%28for%20Clipper%20cards%20only%29.,Clipper%20app%20at%20all%20BART)). (Previously, paper ticket users paid a \$0.50 surcharge per trip ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=being%20sold%20in%20December%202020,plastic%20Clipper%20cards%2C%20BART%20started)), but that is moot now that BART is fully Clipper-only.) Clipper cards can be loaded with cash value or transit passes (for other agencies) and are available as a physical card (one-time \$3 fee) or in digital form (Clipper in Apple Pay/Google Pay, which has no card fee) ([Clipper and Pay by Phone | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/tickets#:~:text=region,entering%20and%20exiting%20a%20station)). Riders who lack sufficient fare to exit (if their card balance is too low when tapping out) can use add-fare machines inside stations to add money before exiting ([Clipper and Pay by Phone | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/tickets#:~:text=If%20you%20ride%20BART%20but,wallet%20if%20you%20use%20Clipper)).

**Fare Levels:** The exact fare for a trip depends on distance and surcharges; for example, a short intra-city ride may be around \$2, whereas a transbay trip from downtown San Francisco to Oakland might be around \$4–\$5, and a long cross-region trip (e.g. from SF to far East Bay) could be \$7–\$9. If a rider enters and exits the **same station** without making a trip, BART charges an “excursion fare” of \$7.10 (essentially a penalty to discourage misuse) ([Clipper and Pay by Phone | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/tickets#:~:text=Excursion%20Fare)). There is also a 3-hour time limit to exit the system (to prevent lingering indefinitely), and a $10 minimum balance warning for the longest possible trip. Notably, within San Francisco, BART riders have an alternative: the **“Muni ‘A’ Fast Pass”**, a monthly pass (sold by SFMTA) that allows unlimited rides on Muni transit plus BART travel *within San Francisco* city stations ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=and%20a%2062.5,93)) – this is the only unlimited-ride option involving BART, and it works via the Clipper card.

**Discounts:** BART offers several fare discounts for eligible riders. **Children under 5** ride free (they do not need a card and must ride with a fare-paying adult) ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=public%20is%20a%206.25,The%20Clipper%20START)). **Youth** from 5 up to 18 get a **50% discount** on fares when using a Youth Clipper card ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=public%20is%20a%206.25,The%20Clipper%20START)). **Senior** riders (65+) and **people with disabilities** receive a **62.5% discount** (about 1/3 of the regular fare) with a Senior or RTC Clipper card ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=public%20is%20a%206.25,The%20Clipper%20START)). For example, a \$4 adult fare would be \$1.50 for a senior. There is also a means-based program called **Clipper START** for lower-income adults: eligible riders can get **50% off** BART fares with a special Clipper START card ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=and%20a%2062.5,93)). (This program is a pilot by the regional MTC agency to make transit more affordable based on income.) Additionally, BART used to sell high-value ticket discounts (e.g. 6.25% bonus for buying \$48 or \$64 in value) ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=public%20is%20a%206.25,The%20Clipper%20START)), but with Clipper that has been phased out in favor of Clipper’s automatic reloading options. All discount travel requires proof of eligibility if requested (e.g. ID for seniors/youth). Transfers between BART and other systems like Muni or Caltrain generally do **not** have a free transfer fare – each system charges separately (with a few exceptions such as a reduced fare for AC Transit bus-to-BART transfers using Clipper, or free transfers between BART and certain VTA light rail stations for Santa Clara residents).

**Purchase Methods:** Clipper card value can be loaded at BART station machines (which accept cash or credit/debit), online, or via the Clipper mobile app. There is also an option to use **Clipper on phone** (Apple Pay or Google Pay) such that riders can tap their phone at the fare gates instead of a physical card ([Clipper and Pay by Phone | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/tickets#:~:text=region,entering%20and%20exiting%20a%20station)). For tourists or one-time riders without Clipper, BART has made Clipper cards easily available for purchase at stations (vending machines dispense new cards). It’s strongly encouraged to use Clipper, as there is no practical way to pay cash fares at gates. BART station agents can assist with issues, and a refund process exists for unused fare balances if needed ([Clipper and Pay by Phone | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/tickets#:~:text=If%20you%20ride%20BART%20but,wallet%20if%20you%20use%20Clipper)). In summary, before entering BART, one must have a Clipper card loaded with enough funds to cover the trip (or plan to add fare at the destination if needed), then **tap in at entry and tap out at exit** – the fare is calculated and deducted accordingly ([Clipper and Pay by Phone | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/tickets#:~:text=Paying%20Your%20Fare)).

## History

**Planning and Construction:** The concept of a regional rapid transit system for the Bay Area emerged in the mid-20th century. The BART District was officially formed in **1957** after California legislation allowed Bay Area counties to form a transit district ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=United%20States%20)). Original member counties included Alameda, Contra Costa, San Francisco, Marin, and San Mateo (though Marin and San Mateo ultimately did not join the initial system). Engineering studies and bond measures in the 1960s paved the way for construction to begin. Groundbreaking took place in 1964, and an ambitious modern system was designed with new technologies (like automated train control and unique wide-gauge tracks). BART’s construction was a massive project, including the excavation of subway tunnels under San Francisco’s Market Street and the construction of the underwater **Transbay Tube** linking SF and Oakland. By the late 1960s, the basic infrastructure was taking shape, and testing of trains began in the early 1970s.

**Opening and Early Years:** BART commenced operation on **September 11, 1972** – on that day the first segment opened between MacArthur Station in Oakland and Fremont in southern Alameda County ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Passenger%20service%20began%20on%20September,hailed%20as%20a%20major%20step)). Over the next two years, additional segments opened in phases: service was extended to Richmond in the north and Concord in the east by 1973, and finally on **September 16, 1974** BART initiated transbay service to San Francisco, completing the original 71-mile system ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Passenger%20service%20began%20on%20September,hailed%20as%20a%20major%20step)). The opening of the Transbay Tube allowed trains to run from Daly City (just south of SF) through downtown San Francisco and under the Bay to Oakland and beyond. The new system was hailed as a cutting-edge modernization of transit, though it faced some early hurdles. In 1972, shortly after launch, a train overran the end of track at Fremont in manual mode (“Fremont Flyer” incident) due to automatic train control issues, prompting a redesign of certain safety systems ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=match%20at%20L1406%20on%20October,multiple%20investigations%20being%20opened%20by)). By 1976, BART’s initial network of lines was fully operational, and ridership steadily grew as commuters adapted to the service.

**Expansion Waves:** After the initial build-out, BART underwent several **major expansions** over the ensuing decades. It wasn’t until the mid-1990s that the first new extensions opened: in **1996**, BART extended service **south of Daly City to Colma** and **east from Concord to Pittsburg/Bay Point**, adding two new end-of-line stations ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Golden%20Gate%20Transportation%20Facilities%20Plan,using%20%20293%20along%20conventional)). In **1997**, the system expanded to the Tri-Valley area with a new line from Bay Fair to **Dublin/Pleasanton**, marking the addition of BART’s fifth service line (Blue Line) ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Over%20twenty%20years%20would%20pass,expanded%20to%20%20270%20San)). The early 2000s saw a landmark extension to San Francisco’s airport – in **June 2003**, BART opened the **SFO/Millbrae Extension**, bringing trains to San Francisco International Airport and down to Millbrae (connecting with Caltrain) ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=extension%20to%20Dublin%2FPleasanton%20%20in,52)). A few years later, BART opened a spur to **Oakland International Airport** in **November 2014** – a driverless people-mover from Coliseum Station replacing the old AirBART bus ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=for%20the%20first%20time%20in,52)). Another infill station, West Dublin/Pleasanton, was added in 2011 (between Castro Valley and Dublin). In the late 2010s, BART realized a long-planned eastward expansion: in **May 2018**, the new **eBART extension to Antioch** began service, using Diesel Multiple Unit trains to reach eastern Contra Costa County beyond Pittsburg/Bay Point ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Francisco%20International%20Airport%20%20in,Point%20and%20Antioch%20on%20the)). Around the same time, BART extended its Fremont line south to Warm Springs/South Fremont (opening in March 2017) ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Yellow%20Line%2C%20opened%20on%20May,53)). Most recently, in **June 2020**, BART opened the first phase of its Silicon Valley extension, extending service into Santa Clara County with new stations at **Milpitas** and **Berryessa/North San José** ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=which%20formed%20in%201957,extension%20in%20partnership%20with%20the)) (in partnership with VTA). This 2020 extension is the latest expansion to date.

**Role in the Region:** BART has dramatically shaped Bay Area travel patterns since its inception. In the 1970s and 1980s, it provided a new transit option in a car-centric region, and its ridership grew especially after pivotal events like the **1989 Loma Prieta earthquake**. During that quake, the Bay Bridge was damaged and closed for a month, but BART’s transbay service resumed quickly – BART became the **only direct link** between San Francisco and the East Bay, resulting in a 17% surge in ridership in the 1990 fiscal year as commuters relied on it while the bridge was repaired ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=the%20Loma%20Prieta%20earthquake%2C%20which,Ridership%20would%20not%20drop)). Over the years, BART has seen ridership spikes for special events (like San Francisco’s 2015 championship parade, which set a single-day record of over 548,000 rides ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=2009%2C%20following%20an%20emergency%20closure,Golden%20State%20Warriors%20championship%20parade))) and consistently high usage for weekday commuting across the Bay. The system’s presence has influenced development, encouraging transit-oriented projects near stations and providing a backbone for the Bay Area’s broader transit network. 

**Modernization:** In recent decades, BART has undertaken significant modernization efforts. By the 2010s, many original 1970s train cars were nearing end of life, so BART ordered a brand-new fleet of trains – the “Fleet of the Future.” These new Bombardier-built cars began service in 2018 and feature modern amenities (improved seating, digital displays, better HVAC). As of 2024, BART has received all **775 new cars** and is phasing out the old fleet entirely ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=,81)). BART is also upgrading its train control system to Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) to allow closer train spacing and increased capacity. Other improvements include adding cellular service in tunnels (as of 2021, all tunnels including the Transbay Tube have cell coverage) ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=from%20Civic%20Center%20to%20Embarcadero,19th%20Street%2C%2012th%20Street%2FOakland%20City)), installing new **canopies and escalators** at downtown SF station entrances for weather protection, and replacing aging infrastructure like tracks and traction power equipment (funded by a voter-approved Measure RR in 2016). BART’s stations have seen enhancements such as brighter LED lighting, improved signage, and the reopening of long-closed restrooms in downtown stations. Additionally, BART is overhauling its fare gates to curb fare evasion – a project to install modern, more secure gates at all stations by 2025 is underway ([New Fare Gates & Station Hardening | Bay Area Rapid Transit - BART](https://www.bart.gov/about/projects/fare-gate#:~:text=BART%20www,by%20the%20end%20of%202025)). These initiatives aim to improve reliability, safety, and the rider experience as the system enters its second half-century of operation.

## Real-time Updates

BART provides extensive **real-time information** to help riders know when the next train is coming and if there are any delays. Each station is equipped with electronic displays on the platforms and concourse that show the **next train departure times** for each line (counting down minutes). These times are updated by BART’s central computer based on train locations and are very accurate. BART also offers real-time data through its official website, mobile app, and open data feeds. The **official BART app** provides live departure times (“next train”) for any station, service advisories, and even indicators if a specific scheduled train run has been canceled ([BART Apps | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/apps#:~:text=%2A%20Real,feed%20and%20the%20Trip%20Planner)). Riders can favorite stations or trips in the app to quickly see relevant live data ([BART Apps | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/apps#:~:text=to%20some%20of%20our%20riders%E2%80%99,most%20pressing%20questions%20and%20issues)). BART’s website similarly has a “Real Time Departures” page where one can select a station and see upcoming trains and their destinations, as well as a live map of train locations.

Under the hood, BART distributes real-time information via standardized data feeds. BART was one of the early adopters of open transit data – it helped create the **GTFS-Realtime (GTFS-RT)** specification for sharing live transit updates ([Developer Program | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/about/developers#:~:text=BART%20GTFS%20Realtime%20BART%20helped,152)). BART provides a GTFS-RT feed that third-party applications (like Google Maps, transit apps, etc.) use to show BART arrivals and service alerts in real time ([BART Legacy API | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/api#:~:text=BART%20Legacy%20API%20,time%20information%2C%20service%20advisories%2C)) ([Alerts and Advisories | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/advisories#:~:text=cancelled%20on%20the%20digital%20monitors,pick%20up%20the%20data%20feed)). In fact, BART shares data on canceled trains, delays, and elevator outages openly so that other apps can incorporate them ([Alerts and Advisories | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/advisories#:~:text=BART%20communicates%20cancelled%20trains%20in,pick%20up%20the%20data%20feed)). In addition, the BART **Developer Program** offers a rich **API** and data downloads: static schedules and fares in GTFS format ([Developer Program | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/about/developers#:~:text=BART%20GTFS%20BART%20was%20one,other%20data%20in%20GTFS%20format)), real-time arrivals and advisories in GTFS-RT and legacy XML formats ([Developer Program | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/about/developers#:~:text=BART%20GTFS%20Realtime%20BART%20helped,152)) ([Developer Program | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/about/developers#:~:text=BART%20RSS%20Feeds%20Service%20Advisories%2C,in%20the%20ubiquitous%20RSS%20format)), as well as station location datasets and an RSS feed for advisories ([Developer Program | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/about/developers#:~:text=BART%20Geospatial%20Data%20District%20boundaries%2C,Get%20it%20here)) ([Developer Program | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/about/developers#:~:text=BART%20System%20Map%20Here%27s%20an,system%20map%20for%20your%20application)). This means developers and chatbot integrators can access up-to-the-minute BART info free of charge, which has led to many third-party tools complementing BART’s own channels.

For riders, **real-time train tracking** is accessible not only on screens but also via audio announcements. In stations, automated announcements (and sometimes station agents) will announce approaching trains and any delays (“Now approaching, train to ___”). On board, automated voices announce the next station. If delays occur, BART’s operations control can override with manual announcements systemwide or at affected stations. BART defines a delay as typically 10 minutes or more behind schedule; these are immediately flagged in real time feeds and station signage. For example, a sign might show “10 min delay – equipment problem.” Minor delays (<10 minutes) may not always be announced systemwide but are often noted on platform signs. The official app allows enabling **push notifications** for specific stations and times, so a rider can get an alert if their usual line is running late ([Alerts and Advisories | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/advisories#:~:text=The%20BART%20official%20app%20offers,exact%20time%20frame%20you%20want)).

BART has also integrated with the regional 511 service, so calling 511 or checking 511.org will give real-time BART status. And during special circumstances (e.g. a major disruption), BART will issue real-time updates via social media and press as well. Overall, the combination of station displays, the BART app, and third-party apps leveraging BART’s data ensures that riders can get **live updates** on train arrivals and any service changes very easily.

## Service Alerts

**Communication Channels:** BART uses multiple channels to communicate **service alerts, delays, and maintenance notices** to the public. The primary source is the **BART Service Advisories** system, which pushes out alerts to various platforms simultaneously. Riders can subscribe to receive BART advisories via **email or text message** – BART offers free subscription services where you can get emails/texts for major delays, planned service changes, elevator outages, etc. ([Alerts and Advisories | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/advisories#:~:text=BART%20offers%20all%20service%20advisories,delay%20advisories%20and%20elevator%20outages)) ([Alerts and Advisories | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/advisories#:~:text=Keep%20Up,Time%20Service%20Notification%20Options)). BART also maintains a dedicated Twitter feed **@SFBARTalert** purely for automated service alerts in real time ([Alerts and Advisories | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/advisories#:~:text=Keep%20Up,Time%20Service%20Notification%20Options)). This Twitter account posts updates whenever there’s a significant delay or interruption (for example, “20-minute delay on Berryessa line due to equipment problem at Lake Merritt”). Many riders follow this or the main @SFBART account for news. In the official BART app, users can enable **push notifications** for service alerts, and even customize them by line or station (the app can send an alert if, say, a station’s escalator is out or if a particular train was canceled) ([Alerts and Advisories | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/advisories#:~:text=The%20BART%20official%20app%20offers,exact%20time%20frame%20you%20want)).

**In-Station Alerts:** Within stations and trains, BART uses audible and visual alerts. Station PA announcements are made for any major delay (“Attention passengers: a delay of 15 minutes due to track maintenance”). Platform message signs also display service advisories – for example, they might alternate between listing next trains and showing a message like “Richmond train delayed 10 min.” If a train is **canceled**, BART communicates this in a targeted way: on the app and website’s real-time departure listings, a canceled train is marked and on station digital signs it will not appear (or be indicated as canceled) ([Alerts and Advisories | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/advisories#:~:text=Cancelled%20Trains)). BART has explained that it doesn’t usually blast a systemwide alert for a single canceled run; instead it provides the info per station so riders see it in context (e.g. a notice at the platform that the 5:33 am from Berryessa was canceled, rather than a generic advisory that might confuse others) ([Alerts and Advisories | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/advisories#:~:text=you%20want)). However, if multiple trains are canceled or a major disruption occurs, a formal **Service Advisory** is issued systemwide (these appear on the BART website banner, on the app, and via Twitter/511).

**Planned Maintenance and Notices:** BART regularly schedules maintenance that may require service changes (such as track work causing single-tracking or bus bridges on some weekends). These planned service advisories are usually posted well in advance on the BART website under **Alerts and Advisories** ([Alerts and Advisories | Bay Area Rapid Transit - BART](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/advisories#:~:text=Alerts%20and%20Advisories%20,BART%20Email%20and%20Text%20Alerts)). They may also be sent to subscribers via the weekly email newsletter or text. At stations, signage is often placed days or weeks ahead (e.g. posters announcing “No Sunday service between Rockridge and Orinda on X date – bus bridge provided”). Major long-term changes (like schedule changes or construction closures) are often accompanied by press releases and social media posts as well. BART’s website has a dedicated **Advisories page** where all current alerts (both real-time and upcoming) are listed, and it offers an **RSS feed** that riders or applications can use to stay updated on advisories ([Developer Program | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/about/developers#:~:text=BART%20System%20Map%20Here%27s%20an,system%20map%20for%20your%20application)) ([Alerts and Advisories | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/advisories#:~:text=Keep%20Up,Time%20Service%20Notification%20Options)).

**Examples of Alerts:** If there is a delay due to a medical emergency, BART will typically announce something like “a major delay on the Fremont line in the southbound direction due to a medical emergency at Hayward” on all channels. As the issue is resolved, they update the alert (“now minor delays”). Service alerts also cover infrastructure issues (equipment problems, power outage, etc.), police activity, weather impacts (e.g. BART may slow trains during a heat wave, which is communicated via alerts), and station-specific problems like an **elevator outage**. BART actually has a special elevator and escalator status dashboard, and the app can send notifications if a particular station’s elevator goes out of service ([Alerts and Advisories | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/advisories#:~:text=BART%20offers%20all%20service%20advisories,delay%20advisories%20and%20elevator%20outages)) – critical for riders with disabilities. 

During emergencies or unusual events, BART’s Communications Center can even override the train PA system to deliver instructions to riders. An infamous example was in 2011 when, during a protest, BART briefly shut off cell service in stations – now BART emphasizes keeping communication open and uses its robust alert system instead. In summary, BART’s approach to service alerts is multi-layered: **digital (email/SMS/app/RSS)**, **social media (Twitter)**, and **on-site (signs/announcements)**, ensuring riders are informed of both real-time disruptions and planned service changes in a timely manner ([Alerts and Advisories | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/advisories#:~:text=,Twitter%20Page)).

## Policies

BART has a **Code of Conduct** and various rider policies to ensure safety, cleanliness, and comfort for all passengers. Here are key rules and guidelines:

- **No Eating or Drinking:** It is **prohibited to eat or drink** in the paid areas of stations and on trains ([Statement from BART General Manager about man cited for eating on the platform | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2019/news20191111#:~:text=I%E2%80%99ve%20seen%20the%20video%20of,Pleasant%20Hill%20station%20on%20Monday)). This longstanding rule is meant to keep trains and stations clean (spilled food can cause slip hazards and attract pests). Signs in stations explicitly state “No food or drink” beyond the fare gates ([Statement from BART General Manager about man cited for eating on the platform | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2019/news20191111#:~:text=I%E2%80%99ve%20seen%20the%20video%20of,Pleasant%20Hill%20station%20on%20Monday)). Violators can technically be cited (fines up to \$250 or community service), though enforcement had been lax in the past. A 2019 incident where a man was detained for eating on a platform sparked public debate and a clarification from BART’s General Manager that while the rule stands, context and judgement should be used in enforcement ([Statement from BART General Manager about man cited for eating on the platform | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2019/news20191111#:~:text=I%E2%80%99ve%20seen%20the%20video%20of,Pleasant%20Hill%20station%20on%20Monday)) ([Statement from BART General Manager about man cited for eating on the platform | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2019/news20191111#:~:text=citation.,through%20out%20the%20entire%20engagement)). Bottom line: riders are asked to wait until they leave the station to consume food or beverages. (However, drinking water is generally tolerated, especially on hot days or for medical needs, and baby bottles are of course allowed for infants.)

- **No Smoking or Vaping:** BART bans **smoking and electronic cigarettes** anywhere in its system – this means no smoking on trains, in stations (including outdoor platforms), or even enclosed areas like elevators ([Injury Prevention & Evacuations | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/safety/safety#:~:text=Roller%20skating%2C%20roller%20blading%2C%20bicycle,wheeled%20vehicles)). The prohibition extends to all forms of tobacco and cannabis use. If caught, riders can face fines. Station announcements occasionally remind “No smoking in the station.” Similarly, **alcohol** consumption is not allowed on BART (opened containers of alcohol are prohibited in stations and trains) ([[PDF] Customer Code of Conduct - BART](https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/08-08-13%20Customer%20CofC.pdf#:~:text=Consume%20any%20alcoholic%20beverage%20or,v)).

- **Bicycles:** BART welcomes bicycles on board with certain rules. As of 2020, bikes are allowed on **all trains at all times**, *except* they are never permitted in the first train car or any **crowded** car where they would impede other passengers ([Bike Rules | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/bikes/bikeRules#:~:text=Bikes%20rules%20beginning%20January%201%2C,2024)). Cyclists must yield to other passengers, avoid blocking doors, and use elevators or stairs (not escalators, until recently) – note: starting Jan 1, 2024, BART even lifted the ban on taking bikes on most escalators, except a few narrow escalators at certain stations ([Bike Rules | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/bikes/bikeRules#:~:text=Beginning%20January%201%2C%202024%2C%20bikes,Antioch%20and%20Oakland%20Airport%20Connector)) ([Bike Rules | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/bikes/bikeRules#:~:text=,to%20seniors%20and%20people%20with)). Riders cannot **ride** their bike in stations (no cycling on platforms or in halls) ([Bike Rules | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/bikes/bikeRules#:~:text=,not%20block%20aisles%20or%20doors)); they must walk it. Bikes should be held securely – either by the owner or placed in the designated bike rack areas on newer trains. If a train becomes too crowded, cyclists are expected to off-board and wait for the next train. Folding bikes are allowed on all cars without restriction since they can be stowed like luggage ([Bike Rules | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/bikes/bikeRules#:~:text=,to%20seniors%20and%20people%20with)). Motorized scooters or bikes that run on gas are *not* allowed on BART for safety reasons ([Bike Rules | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/bikes/bikeRules#:~:text=,locked%20at%20racks%20or%20inside)). Overall, BART’s bike program is fairly robust: many stations have bike parking, and some even have staffed **Bike Stations** for secure storage. These policies have evolved (BART used to ban bikes during peak hours in the past), but now emphasize courtesy and safety over time-based restrictions.

- **Pets and Service Animals:** Only trained **service animals** (for disabilities) are allowed to be on BART without a carrier. Service dogs must be on leash and under the owner’s control at all times. Non-service animals, including emotional support animals and pets, **must be in a secure carrier** to ride BART ([Service Animals/Pets | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/pets#:~:text=Pets)). The carrier must be fully closed and the animal should not disturb other riders. Small pets like cats or small dogs in airline-style pet carriers are commonly seen on BART. Larger dogs that are not service animals are effectively not allowed unless they can fit in a carrier. BART’s policy explicitly notes that animals whose sole function is to provide emotional support do *not* qualify as service animals under ADA and thus must be in carriers ([Service Animals/Pets | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/pets#:~:text=Pets)). So, for example, a therapy dog or comfort pet has to be crated like any pet. During off-peak hours one might see some leniency (some operators may not strictly enforce the carrier rule if the car is empty), but officially the rule stands. Service animals in training (if they are dogs) are permitted if they are being trained by a person with a disability or an authorized trainer ([Service Animals/Pets | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/pets#:~:text=trained%20to%20provide%20must%20be,related%20to%20the%20person%27s%20disability)), and BART even offers free rides for those actively training guide dogs on the system with prior arrangement ([Service Animals/Pets | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/pets#:~:text=animal%20that%20the%20animal%20cannot,enter%20the%20station)).

- **Noise and Behavior:** BART asks riders to conduct themselves respectfully. **Loud music** or sound from electronic devices must be silenced or used with headphones. It’s against the rules to play music aloud or otherwise disturb others. **Feet on seats**, vandalism (like graffiti or scratching windows), and littering are prohibited. In recent years BART has had issues with people using the trains for **panhandling or performances** (like loud singing or acrobatics between the poles); these are not allowed without permit, and BART police occasionally enforce against these for safety reasons. **Priority seating** near train doors is marked for seniors and persons with disabilities – riders are expected to yield those seats when needed (it’s a courtesy rule, not a strict law). 

- **Safety Rules:** BART prohibits hazardous items: no flammable materials, car batteries, gasoline cans, or large appliances, etc. on board ([Injury Prevention & Evacuations | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/safety/safety#:~:text=Smoking%20or%20vaping%20is%20prohibited,in%20stations%20or%20on%20trains)). Also, **roller skates, scooters, skateboards** may not be ridden inside stations or on trains (you can carry them). BART has a small police force (BART Police) that enforces laws within the system, including the state law that requires riders to have proof of payment (fare evasion can result in citations). There is also a prohibition on **fare evasion** (jumping fare gates or sneaking in) – BART has been tightening gate security to combat this.

- **COVID-19 and Health:** (As an update, BART aligned with local health orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. For a period, face **masks** were required on BART; as of early 2023 masks are optional but “strongly recommended.” BART distributed free masks and hand sanitizer during the pandemic. Those rules evolved with health guidelines.)

Overall, BART’s rider policies are similar to other transit systems: **keep aisles clear, no smoking, no eating/drinking, yield seats to those in need, and be considerate of others**. Violations of rules like eating/drinking or fare evasion are infractions that BART Police can cite. Serious offenses (assault, vandalism) are of course subject to arrest. BART often reminds riders, via posters and announcements, of these guidelines – for example, “Keep BART safe: if you see something, say something” for security, or courtesy reminders like letting people exit the train before boarding, and not holding train doors (holding doors can delay the train). The BART website provides the full **Customer Code of Conduct** which enumerates all do’s and don’ts in detail ([[PDF] Customer Code of Conduct - BART](https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/08-08-13%20Customer%20CofC.pdf#:~:text=Consume%20any%20alcoholic%20beverage%20or,v)).

## Current Operations and Projects

As of 2025, BART is undergoing significant changes and improvements while adjusting to evolving ridership patterns. The COVID-19 pandemic (2020) led to a steep drop in ridership, and although ridership is recovering, it remains below pre-2020 levels on weekdays (about 45% of pre-pandemic) and somewhat higher on weekends. BART now carries ~50 million trips annually (2024) compared to 120+ million in 2019 ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Connector%20%2C%20a%203,BART%20is%20the%20%20224)). This has financial implications and has prompted BART to consider service adjustments and cost-saving measures. Nonetheless, the agency remains committed to expansion and modernization:

- **New Fleet Deployment:** BART’s entire fleet of legacy trains (dating from 1970s-1980s) is being replaced by the new **“Fleet of the Future”** trains. All 775 new cars have been delivered and nearly all are in service, with a handful still undergoing testing ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=,81)). As of mid-2024, BART had over 750 of these cars certified and running ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=,81)), allowing the retirement of the old blue-and-white trains. The new trains have more doors (3 per side) for faster boarding, clearer audio and digital signage, better ventilation, and are quieter and smoother. BART is gradually increasing the train lengths and frequency as more new cars come online. The **legacy fleet decommissioning** is expected to be completed by 2025 ([Clipper and Pay by Phone | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/tickets#:~:text=,Role%20In%20The%20Region)). Riders now mostly ride these new trains, improving reliability (they break down far less often than the old ones) and comfort. A few legacy cars might be kept for special events or backups until everything is settled.

- **Service Adjustments:** BART has been tweaking its service schedules to match demand. In 2021, BART expanded evening service (restoring midnight closures 7 days a week) and in 2023 made a notable schedule change to run **more frequent trains on the Yellow Line** (Antioch–SFO) given higher ridership there ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=San%20Jos%C3%A9%20%20Richmond%20,service%20ends%20at%20Millbrae)). Conversely, weekend schedules were adjusted for efficiency, and some early morning weekday trains were re-timed. The agency is monitoring commute patterns – with more people telecommuting, BART’s traditional rush-hour peaks have flattened somewhat, so they are exploring a more even headway-based schedule all day. However, funding constraints might lead to reduced frequencies in off-peak hours if emergency subsidies dry up. BART is also planning for the opening of additional stations and wants to ensure it has enough operators and trains when that happens.

- **Silicon Valley Extension (Phase II):** The **BART to Silicon Valley** project is ongoing. After the 2020 opening to Berryessa, the next phase (known as Phase II) will extend BART about 6 miles further to central San José and Santa Clara. This extension will include a long subway tunnel through downtown San José. Four new stations are planned: **28th Street/Little Portugal, Downtown San José (near Santa Clara St), Diridon Station (San José), and Santa Clara** (near the Caltrain station) ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Planned%20)). This is a massive project led by VTA. As of 2025, utility relocation and design are underway; major construction is expected to start soon. The timeline estimates completion by **2036** for revenue service ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Lines,53)). When done, BART will directly serve San José (California’s third-largest city) and connect with Caltrain and future high-speed rail at Diridon. Funding was bolstered in 2023 by federal grants. Current operations are not yet affected, but eventually BART will have to integrate this extension (likely as an Orange line continuation).

- **Infill Stations:** BART has plans for new stations on existing lines. The most advanced is **Irvington Station** in Fremont, which will fill the 5-mile gap between Fremont and Warm Springs/South Fremont. This infill station is funded and in design – located in the Irvington district, it is slated to open around 2027-2029 ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Plans%20had%20long%20been%20floated,to%20Caltrain%20and%20the%20future)). Irvington Station will have parking and facilitate transit-oriented development in that area. Another proposed infill station is **Calaveras (downtown Milpitas)**, which was contemplated but may not proceed now that Berryessa opened nearby ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Plans%20had%20long%20been%20floated,to%20Caltrain%20and%20the%20future)). In Oakland, there’s been discussion of a new station between West Oakland and 12th St (to serve Jack London Square area), but it’s very conceptual. So, Irvington is the main upcoming infill station to watch.

- **Second Transbay Tube (Link21):** BART and regional planners are in early planning for a future **Second Transbay Rail Crossing**. The concept, often called **“Link21,”** envisions a new rail tunnel under the Bay that would carry BART trains and possibly standard-gauge commuter trains ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=range%20plans%20included%20a%20new,CCJPA%29%20had)). This would likely connect Oakland to San Francisco via a different alignment (perhaps landing in Mission Bay or South of Market in SF) and could allow BART extensions to new areas as well as direct Caltrain/Amtrak service across the Bay ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Transbay%20Transit%20Terminal%20%20to,routes%20to%20serve%20San%20Francisco)). It’s a long-term project (construction could be 15–20 years away), but planning funds have been allocated for studying alignments and technologies. If built, a second tube would dramatically increase transbay capacity and resilience (important given the current tube nearing its peak capacity and being a single point of failure). Current operations aren’t affected yet, but in coming years BART may start setting aside capital funds for this and coordinating with agencies like Capitol Corridor and Caltrain.

- **Station Modernization:** BART is investing in station upgrades systemwide. **Downtown San Francisco stations** are getting new street entry canopies (Embarcadero through Civic Center all will have secure glass canopies with escalator weather protection and gates that lock when stations are closed). This also includes replacing or refurbishing escalators – already Powell and Civic Center have new escalators installed. **Lighting** and painting projects are ongoing (e.g. brighter lighting at Balboa Park, fresh paint at El Cerrito del Norte, etc.). BART is also adding **platform screen doors** in concept: they ran a pilot of prototype platform edge doors at the 19th St Oakland station to test feasibility for crowded stations in the future. Elevators have been overhauled at many stations to improve reliability, and BART launched an Elevator Attendant program at downtown stations to keep them clean and safe.

- **Fare Evasion Prevention:** A current focus is reducing fare evasion, which has been a persistent problem. BART is rolling out new, taller and more robust **fare gates** across all stations by 2025 ([New Fare Gates & Station Hardening | Bay Area Rapid Transit - BART](https://www.bart.gov/about/projects/fare-gate#:~:text=BART%20www,by%20the%20end%20of%202025)). The new gates (sometimes called “next generation fare gates”) are designed to be harder to jump or tamper with – they have higher barriers and use a sweeping motion. Stations like Richmond, Fruitvale, and Downtown SF have piloted these gates and seen positive results. By end of 2025, all 50 stations are expected to have the new gate technology ([New Fare Gates & Station Hardening | Bay Area Rapid Transit - BART](https://www.bart.gov/about/projects/fare-gate#:~:text=BART%20www,by%20the%20end%20of%202025)). BART is also increasing fare enforcement by BART Police and Transit Ambassadors to ensure people pay their fares, as lost revenue from evasion has become more critical with lower ridership.

- **Service and Technology:** BART’s new **Train Control Modernization Project** is underway, aiming to replace the 50-year-old automatic train control system with a modern CBTC system by late 2020s ([Bikes on BART | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/guide/bikes#:~:text=)). This will eventually enable trains to run closer together, potentially increasing throughput especially through the Transbay corridor (from ~24 trains/hour currently to 30+). In the meantime, BART continues periodic maintenance projects: e.g. a multi-year effort to rebuild track and electrical infrastructure in the Transbay Tube was completed in 2022, known as the “Transbay Tube seismic retrofit” – which was why BART started at 5am instead of 4am for several years to allow overnight work ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=The%20Early%20Bird%20Express%20network,21)). Also, BART’s **Hayward Maintenance Complex** expansion is being built to provide more capacity for maintaining the new fleet. 

- **Regional Integration:** BART is coordinating more with neighboring transit. The opening of Salesforce Transit Center in San Francisco (2018) created a hub one block from Embarcadero Station for transbay buses and future high-speed rail, so BART has partnered on signage and wayfinding for transfers. In the South Bay, when BART eventually reaches Diridon Station, it will link with Caltrain and Amtrak – so current planning is considering a **unified fare system** (Clipper is moving towards fare integration by 2024+ which could simplify transfers between BART and other systems). Also, a separate project called **Valley Link** is proposing to connect BART’s Dublin/Pleasanton terminus to the Central Valley (Tri-Valley and beyond) with a diesel light rail – not a BART project per se, but it will interface with BART’s system. BART is actively part of discussions on fare policy (e.g. a pilot in 2022 called **BayPass** gave some college students unlimited rides on all Bay Area transit including BART to study ridership impact ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=match%20at%20L1623%20In%20August,students%20and%20affordable%20housing%20residents))).

In summary, BART’s current operations involve balancing the immediate needs of restoring ridership post-pandemic and maintaining service quality, with long-term projects that will expand and improve the system. Riders can expect more new trains, cleaner and safer stations, and gradually more service as funding stabilizes. Landmark projects on the horizon – San José extension and a potential second Transbay Tube – indicate that BART will continue to grow beyond its original footprint. Internally, BART is making safety a top priority (after some incidents, CPUC has monitored BART’s safety practices), and the agency is on probation by state regulators due to past safety lapses in 2013 ([

Financially, BART faces challenges, but a combination of federal aid (in the short term) and potential new local funding (there’s talk of a regional funding measure in 2026) will influence service levels. Despite these challenges, BART remains an essential backbone of Bay Area transit and is poised for upgrades that riders will see in the form of more reliable and convenient service in the coming years.

## Historical Information (Milestones and Incidents)

- **1946–1957 (Origins):** Civic leaders conceive a regional transit system after WWII (1946 study proposes Bay Area rail network). The San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District is officially formed in **1957** by the state, initially including SF, Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Mateo counties ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=United%20States%20)). Marin and San Mateo opt out by 1962, shaping the final BART district.

- **1964 (Construction Starts):** Construction of BART begins. Key early projects include the Transbay Tube (started 1965), Oakland subway, Berkeley Hills Tunnel, and Market Street subway in SF. Over \$900 million in bonds (approved 1962) finance the initial system.

- **September 11, 1972 (Opening Day):** BART opens for passenger service between Oakland (MacArthur) and Fremont. This is the first new U.S. rapid transit system in over 60 years at the time ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Passenger%20service%20began%20on%20September,hailed%20as%20a%20major%20step)). Fanfare is tempered when an automated train overruns the end-of-line a few weeks later at Fremont (no fatalities, but it leads to manual speed checks being added) ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=match%20at%20L1406%20on%20October,multiple%20investigations%20being%20opened%20by)).

- **1973–1974 (System Completion):** BART extends to Richmond (Jan 1973) and Concord (May 1973). On **September 16, 1974**, the **Transbay Tube** opens for service, allowing trains from Daly City into San Francisco and across to Oakland ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Passenger%20service%20began%20on%20September,hailed%20as%20a%20major%20step)). The initial 71-mile system with 34 stations is now fully operational.

- **1976 (Transbay Fare Increase):** Financial challenges lead BART to implement a 25¢ transbay surcharge, the first step towards the distance-based plus surcharge fare structure.

- **January 17, 1979 (Transbay Tube Fire):** A westbound BART train in the Transbay Tube catches fire due to an electrical short. Passengers are evacuated, but tragically one Oakland firefighter loses his life responding to the blaze ([Transbay Tube - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transbay_Tube#:~:text=Transbay%20Tube%20,Lodi)). The incident shuts BART’s cross-bay service for several weeks. It leads to major safety upgrades: installation of fire-resistant materials, improved emergency procedures, and new ventilation systems in the Tube (these enhancements later become industry standards ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=During%20the%201989%20Loma%20Prieta,69))).

- **1980s (Ridership Growth and New Connections):** BART ridership gradually grows. In 1980, Daly City becomes a transfer point for SamTrans buses as San Mateo County commuters increasingly use BART. In 1983, Richmond Station becomes an intermodal hub with the introduction of Amtrak **Capitol Corridor** trains stopping there.

- **October 17, 1989 (Loma Prieta Earthquake):** The 6.9 quake strikes the Bay Area, causing the Bay Bridge to close for a month. BART suffers minimal damage and restores service swiftly ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=During%20the%201989%20Loma%20Prieta,69)). It becomes the **only viable transbay connection**, carrying record numbers of passengers during the bridge closure ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=the%20Loma%20Prieta%20earthquake%2C%20which,Ridership%20would%20not%20drop)). BART’s tunnels proved resilient, and this event cemented BART’s importance in regional emergency response.

- **1995–1997 (First Extensions):** After two decades with the original network, BART opens its first extensions. **Colma Station** opens south of Daly City in February 1996 ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Golden%20Gate%20Transportation%20Facilities%20Plan,using%20%20293%20along%20conventional)), and in East Bay the line from Concord is extended to **North Concord (1995) and Pittsburg/Bay Point (Dec 1996)** ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Golden%20Gate%20Transportation%20Facilities%20Plan,using%20%20293%20along%20conventional)). Then in May **1997**, the new **Dublin/Pleasanton line** opens, extending service to Eastern Alameda County and adding the Blue Line service pattern ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Over%20twenty%20years%20would%20pass,expanded%20to%20%20270%20San)).

- **2003 (SFO Extension):** On **June 22, 2003**, BART service begins to **San Francisco International Airport (SFO)** and **Millbrae** ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=extension%20to%20Dublin%2FPleasanton%20%20in,52)). This high-profile project adds a spur line south of Colma and brings BART into San Mateo County for the first time. The extension includes an innovative wye track that allows some trains to go SF–Millbrae and others SF–SFO. Ridership increases, especially for airport travelers. (SFO became one of the few U.S. airports with a direct rail link.)

- **January 1, 2009 (Oscar Grant Incident):** In the early hours of New Year’s Day, **Oscar Grant III**, a 22-year-old passenger, is fatally shot by a BART Police officer at Fruitvale Station during an arrest, in view of many bystanders ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=On%20January%201%2C%202009%2C%20a,in%20the%20days)). The incident, captured on video, sparks widespread protests and discussions about police accountability. It leads to the creation of BART’s Independent Police Auditor and Citizen Review Board for greater oversight of the BART Police. (This tragedy was later depicted in the film *Fruitvale Station*.)

- **September 2009 (TransLink/Clipper launch):** BART becomes one of the first agencies to accept the TransLink smart card (renamed Clipper) for fare payment ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=,Tickets)), paving the way for the full transition to Clipper in the 2010s.

- **July & Oct 2013 (Labor Strikes and Accident):** BART workers (ATU and SEIU unions) stage strikes in **July 2013** and again in **October 2013** over contract negotiations, halting all BART service for several days each time. During the second strike, on **October 19, 2013**, a tragic accident occurs: with trained operators absent, a BART manager and a trainee are operating an out-of-service train for maintenance and strike duty, and they **strike and kill two track workers** (a BART employee and a contractor) near Walnut Creek ([

](https://www.progressiverailroading.com/safety/news/BART-fined-13-million-for-2013-track-worker-deaths--55877#:~:text=safety%20violations%2C%20CPUC%20officials%20said,in%20a%20news%20release)). This happened on Day 2 of the strike, under a practice called “simple approval” (workers on tracks with trains moving at full speed). The incident led to the strike ending (unions and BART reached agreement shortly after), and it prompted a multi-year safety investigation. Cal/OSHA later fined BART and the CPUC imposed a record \$1.3 million fine for safety violations leading to those deaths ([

As a result, BART overhauled its track worker safety procedures, eliminating “simple approval” (now work zones must be protected with positive train control or manual oversight) and instituting new protocols. The 2013 strikes were the first BART work stoppages since 1997, and the fatalities during the strike remain one of BART’s darkest moments.

- **2014 (Oakland Airport Connector):** In November 2014, BART opens the **Oakland International Airport (OAK) Connector**, an automated mini-line from Coliseum Station to the airport ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=for%20the%20first%20time%20in,52)). It replaces a shuttle bus and offers a 8-minute driverless ride. While separate technology (cable-driven cars), it’s integrated into BART’s fare system.

- **2016 (Measure RR):** Voters approve Measure RR, a \$3.5 billion bond for BART infrastructure upgrades. This funding (passing with over 70% support) is earmarked for rebuilding track, power, tunnels, structures, and stations over the next decades, reflecting public commitment to BART’s state of good repair.

- **May 26, 2018 (Antioch eBART):** BART extends service to **Antioch** using diesel multiple-unit (DMU) trains on standard-gauge track east of Pittsburg/Bay Point ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=Francisco%20International%20Airport%20%20in,Point%20and%20Antioch%20on%20the)). This extension, called eBART, adds two new stations (Pittsburg Center and Antioch) and uses a cross-platform transfer for riders continuing to/from the electric BART system. It effectively expands BART’s reach into eastern Contra Costa County with a lower-cost rail technology.

- **June 8, 2020 (Silicon Valley Extension Phase I):** Service begins on the **Berryessa Extension**, adding **Milpitas** and **Berryessa/North San José** stations ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=which%20formed%20in%201957,extension%20in%20partnership%20with%20the)). This marks BART’s entry into Santa Clara County. The opening, originally planned for 2019, was delayed to 2020 and happened amid the COVID-19 pandemic with little fanfare (no large ceremony due to health orders). It extends the Green and Orange lines by about 10 miles. Phase II towards downtown San José is in design.

- **2020 (COVID-19 Pandemic):** Starting in March 2020, the pandemic causes ridership to plummet by as much as 90%. BART dramatically cuts service (running only until 9pm for a period, closing many entrances, etc.). Extra cleaning protocols are implemented (e.g. UV disinfecting devices, frequent sanitization). Federal relief funds help BART avoid layoffs. Ridership has slowly recovered through 2021–2024 but remains permanently altered with more remote work.

- **2022 (Clipper Only & Restrooms):** BART completes its transition to **Clipper-only** fares – magstripe paper tickets are fully phased out by December 2022 ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=%28for%20Clipper%20cards%20only%29.,Clipper%20app%20at%20all%20BART)). Also in 2022, BART begins reopening the long-closed **underground station restrooms**, starting with Powell and 19th St stations ([Restrooms at Powell Street Station reopen on 2/2/22 | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2022/news20220131#:~:text=On%20Wednesday%2C%20February%202%2C%202022%2C,now%20during%20the%20pandemic%20recovery)) ([Restrooms at Powell Street Station reopen on 2/2/22 | Bay Area Rapid Transit](https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2022/news20220131#:~:text=1B,Oakland%20on%20February%2025%2C%202022)). By 2023, several downtown stations in SF and Oakland have operational restrooms again, restoring an amenity closed since 9/11/2001.

- **2024 (Fleet Replacement):** BART by now has received all new train cars and is operating the majority of service with the new fleet ([Bay Area Rapid Transit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit#:~:text=,81)). Old trains are being retired from service after over 45 years of operation. BART also initiates testing of a new elevator/escalator queuing system and platform screen door concepts to further modernize stations.

These milestones highlight BART’s evolution from a novel 1970s transit experiment to a mature backbone of Bay Area transportation. BART’s history includes high points like pivotal extensions and ridership records, as well as low points like accidents and challenges. Each event has shaped the system’s policies and improvements – for instance, the 1979 fire led to better fire safety, the Oscar Grant incident led to police oversight reforms, and the 2013 strike tragedy led to new track safety rules. Moving forward, BART’s historical trajectory of expansion and innovation is set to continue as it builds out to San Jose and pursues a second Transbay crossing, ensuring that history is still being made on BART.
